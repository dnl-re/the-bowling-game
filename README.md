# The Bowling Game

This project is part of my Apprenticeship Program at kloseBrothers. The goal is to fullfill the requirements of the following code kata by using TDD, Test Driven Development.

## Code Kata - Problem Description

Create a program, which, given a valid sequence of rolls for one line of American Ten-Pin Bowling, produces the total score for the game.

### Example

- X X X X X X X X X X X X (12 rolls: 12 strikes) = 10 frames \* 30 points = 300
- 9- 9- 9- 9- 9- 9- 9- 9- 9- 9- (20 rolls: 10 pairs of 9 and miss) = 10 frames \* 9 points = 90
- 5/ 5/ 5/ 5/ 5/ 5/ 5/ 5/ 5/ 5/5 (21 rolls: 10 pairs of 5 and spare, with a final 5) = 10 frames \* 15 points = 150
